[![View on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/View%20on-GitHub-181717?logo=github&style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/shushantrishav/Blockchain_In_Retail)


A decentralized, transparent, and secure platform for managing retail transactions and loyalty points using blockchain technology.

---

## 📌 1️⃣ Problem Statement

Traditional retail systems often suffer from:

- **Lack of Transparency:** Unclear data usage and loyalty point management.
- **Centralized Control:** Vulnerable to breaches and arbitrary rule changes.
- **Interoperability Issues:** Loyalty points locked within single brands.
- **Fraud and Disputes:** No immutable transaction records.
- **Inefficient Record Keeping:** Expensive, slow databases for large transaction volumes.

**✅ Solution:** Leverage blockchain to provide decentralized, transparent, and tamper-proof retail transaction management.
